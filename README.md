# Password-Generator

## Overview
This project was created to showcase JavaScript skills and just in case a new password would
be need for any case. While this project did contain a starter code almost all of the JavaScript 
was empty and was left for me to fill out. The JavaScript was complex and involved alot of googling
and looking at notes but was very statifed once it was all done and the webpage worked.
